Notebooks for the 2025 Cloud Fall School in Bologna (Oct 13-17, 2025), co-organized by [CMCC](https://www.cmcc.it/), the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en), and [EGI](https://www.egi.eu/).

In this intensive, week-long course, you'll gain hands-on experience with coastal ocean modeling on the cloud. Through a mix of lectures and practical labs, you will learn how to:

* Run numerical coastal ocean models on cloud platforms.
* Optimize large model and remote sensing datasets for efficient cloud access.
* Analyze and visualize large multidimensional datasets using open-source, cloud-based tools.
* Build your own cloud-native workflow using a dataset that interests you.

You'll leave with practical skills and curated resources for your continued learning.

We used the [Pangeo@EOSC JupyterHub](https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/) with Dask Gateway and S3-compatible storage, selecting the `quay.io/globalcoast/protocoast-notebook:main` image for our server.
