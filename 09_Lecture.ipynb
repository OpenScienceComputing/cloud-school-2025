    "## Lecture 9: Introduction to Dask\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask is an open-source Python library for parallel computing. It's designed to scale your existing Python code and libraries, like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, from a single machine with multiple cores to a large distributed cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The core idea behind Dask is to handle datasets that are too large to fit into a computer's memory. It does this by breaking down large datasets and computations into smaller, manageable tasks that can be processed in parallel. It uses a dynamic task scheduler to manage and execute these tasks efficiently.\n",
