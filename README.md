## Objectives
In this intensive, week-long course, students learn cloud native approaches and tools for working with multidimensional Earth Science data on the cloud. Through a mix of lectures and practical labs, student learn how to:

* Run numerical coastal ocean models on cloud platforms.
* Optimize large model and remote sensing datasets for efficient cloud access.
* Analyze and visualize large multidimensional datasets using open-source, cloud-based tools.
* Build their own cloud-native workflow using datasets that interest them.

They leave with practical skills with immediate benefit, and resources for continued learning.

## Infrastructure 
This course used the [Pangeo@EOSC JupyterHub](https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/) with Dask Gateway and S3-compatible storage, with the custom `quay.io/globalcoast/protocoast-notebook:main` environment.
