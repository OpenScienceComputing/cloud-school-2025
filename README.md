# Cloud-Native Earth Science Data Analysis and Visualization School
Co-organized by [CMCC](https://www.cmcc.it/), the [University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en), and [EGI](https://www.egi.eu/).
## Objectives
In this intensive, week-long course, students learn cloud native approaches and tools for working with multidimensional Earth Science data on the cloud. Through a mix of lectures and practical labs, student learn how to:

* Run numerical coastal ocean models on cloud platforms.
* Optimize large model and remote sensing datasets for efficient cloud access.
* Analyze and visualize large multidimensional datasets using open-source, cloud-based tools.
* Build their own cloud-native workflow using datasets that interest them.

They leave with practical skills with immediate benefit, and resources for continued learning.

## Feedback
 [School Feedback Responses](./pangeo_class_survey_results.pdf)
Holoviz and Virtualizarr/Icechunk were the tools that excited students the most, and I was very happy that the students would recommend the class to others:
